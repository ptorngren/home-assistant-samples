# Home Assistant Samples

Some Home Assistant examples and experiments that might be generally useful. Use freely, adapt as needed, no guarantees — have fun and let me know if you have any issues or suggestions!

## Is There More?

I've also been playing with setting up Home Assistant for my Yamaha MusicCast multi-room audio system and scheduling the car heaters. Hope to publish these samples as well after some polishing.

## About This Project

This project represents an experiment in learning YAML and the Home Assistant ecosystem; 
as a long-time (now retired) software developer I found the learning threshold rather steep.
While experienced in traditional programming, the Home Assistant domain was new territory, 
particularly its YAML configuration language, templating patterns and HACS components.

Rather than learning entirely through trial-and-error, this project was developed with heavy 
reliance on AI tools to accelerate learning and code generation:

- **Claude Code** — Primary development tool with Home Assistant MCP integration and IntelliJ IDEA plugin
- **Gemini** — Supplementary tool for specific technical questions and alternative approaches

This approach allowed rapid prototyping and iteration while focusing intellectual energy on architecture and design rather than language syntax. 
The AI tools acted as accelerators and technical collaborators, not replacements for design thinking or testing.
It's been an interesting experiment in blending human creativity with AI assistance in software development, 
and I must say the results have been impressive! All the fun of coding with most of the tedious typing and syntax errors eliminated.

**Note:** All code has been reviewed and tested "in production" (at home), but I do not claim that it works for you. 
None of this should be considered a product, but rather a shared experience that may inspire fellow automators. Or the opposite ;-)
